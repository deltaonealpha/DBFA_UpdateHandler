DBFA Inception 1.0
deltaonealpha | November 2020


Donnager. Inception. DBFA.

Successor to our earlier "Donnager" series of builds (DBFA 1 to 8), the INCEPTION is here.
With Inception, we are releasing what we consider the first truly mature build of DBFA, ready for prime-time usage and bug-tested to the dot. 

Presenting, DBFA INCEPTION 1.0.

Changelog:
Quirky Highlights:
-        Presenting SUPERCACHING: Unlike other codes which refer db values for every product, thereby adding time delay, DBFA fetches all details when the billing is started, and caches the data in its memory, thereby greatly increasing speed and reliability. SUPERCACHING is dynamically refreshed whenever the source is changed.

-        DBFA now maintains a ‚Äústore group‚Äù with all employees where the schedule is sent daily.


Store Telegram Group


-        The way DBFA handles product listing has been completely revamped: Product listing has been moved to database storage.

-        You can now add a new product listing from DBFA itself.

-        DBFA now automatically detects its installation directory, even if moved from the original place.

-        Presenting login accounts control, leading security measures and more, scroll down!

-----------------



Time and Speed:
-        Optimized DBFA to boot 46% faster! (9.9 seconds faster (19 seconds >>> 10.1 seconds)).

-        Reduced menu loading time by 2 seconds.

-----------------



Updater & Deployment:
-        Presenting DBFA Backup & Switch v2.0 with backup restoration. Restoration needs the backup installation‚Äôs admin password to restore. Backup metadata is scanned, and files are updated accordingly.


File dialog opens to allow the user to select the backup package


-        UPDATER 2.0 not only downloads updates on its own, it can also automatically deploy update files, increment version IDs, and make relevant data structure changes and clean-up post updating DBFA. The update changelog is also shown prior to obtaining update confirmation from the user.

[Yes we don't choke you with "UPDATE NOW YOU CUNT" prompts üòâ ]

Security & Security Dashboard:
-        Presenting DBFA Login Accounts: Multiple accounts can now be used to log into DBFA (1 x admin-level; unlimited cashier-level) with restricted access for non-admins. Login script has a checkbox to choose from, though usernames can still be typed.


New login page showing multi-account login
-        Presenting the DBFA Security Dashboard: Gives you a visual representation of program and dependencies health, with security-related options (clear records/ change passwords/ encryption toggle, 2FA toggle/ create login accounts)
